## My process

### Built with

- [Create-React-App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) - Toolchain
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For Styles
- [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) - For GitHub Page deployment

### What I learned

The data handling is a bit wonky but it works =)
I spent a lot of time making it responsive, if only I planned the layout beforehand.
